During in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) tests 
embryos for chromosomal abnormalities, intending to improve pregnancy outcomes. The efficacy of 
PGT-A remains debated due to conflicting results from various studies and the current methodologies 
used, particularly when identifying chromosomal mosaicism. This study uses computational modelling 
to explore the plausibility of mosaicism in all embryos, with a particular focus on those classified as 
Euploid (0 aneuploid cells in a 5-cell biopsy) due to their viability for transfer. Using a custom R 
package and functions, I simulated populations of embryos with varying proportions of aneuploidy and 
took virtual biopsies of these simulated embryos, comparing the biopsy results to the International 
Registry of Mosaic Embryo Transfers (IRMET) data outcomes. Computational simulations supported 
that all euploid embryos within a population could exhibit low levels of mosaicism up to 8% of 
aneuploidy in the entire embryo. It does not appear that low-level mosaicism affects embryo viability 
because pregnancy outcomes from euploid embryos are positive, suggesting that 8% or less aneuploidy 
is not a major concern. While current classification methods risk euploid embryos being misclassified 
as viable for transfer or extent of mosaicism overestimated and a viable embryo discarded, it is vital to 
further investigate the biological relevance and impact of mosaicism on embryonic development and 
refine computational models to account for this, as well as complete further analysis on mosaicism of 
other threshold classes such as the Aneuploid, to confirm whether an entire population has the potential 
to exhibit mosaicism.
